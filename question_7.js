some():- 

Array.some() executes a given function on each element of the array and returns truthy or falsy value.

If any of the element passes the test function it will return true and if elements will not pass the function then it will return false.

This method take five parameters.

First two parameter which is described below is mandatory rest all three are optional.

1) callback Function:- A function to execute for each element in the array. 
                       It should return a truthy to indicate the element passes the test, and a falsy value otherwise.

2) element:- This is passed as an argument inside callback function to hold the value of the current element of the array.

3) index:- This passed argument is optional and inside callback function, and it holds the current index value of the array.

4) array:- This passed argument is also optional and  inside callback function, and it is array on which some() was called.

5) thisArg:- A value to use as this when executing callback Function.
